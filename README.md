An imporved version *unx command 

##1. what
what is an improved version of the *w* tool. It finds all processes associated with a TTY(not just those registered in wtmp), and reports all users that are running anything. In particular, unlike w, what will also shows things running in detached screen/tmuxen. 
    
Example output:

```console
$./what

```
